## 5 code improvements you can apply today to make your website more accessible
[5 code improvements article](https://medium.com/design-signals/5-code-improvements-you-can-apply-today-to-make-your-website-more-accessible-9e6e36cb18a0)

Five changes to your code that you can apply in a couple of hours but that make a big difference.

#### Nr. 1 — Fix general code semantics
Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code. MDN — which is my favorite source to look up various features of the web platform — has a very good description of what it means for HTML, CSS and JavaScript to be “semantic” (I recommend to quickly read through the referenced page).

#### Nr. 2 — Fix your title structure
Even if you have all your titles wrapped in correct H1 to H6 elements, that doesn’t automatically mean that they are used correctly.
 
#### Nr. 3 — Add hidden titles to the structure to mark site sections for screen readers
This improvement belongs to the 20% mentioned at the beginning of this post: This is not something an automatic testing suite will tell you. These are the additional content improvements you either tackle based on feedback from manual testings or by gut feeling.

#### Nr. 4 — Fix your forms
There are more things that can go wrong with forms than I initially thought, before I dove into accessibility. This is not mentioned in Nr. 1 of this post as it’s not only about semantics. There are a few additional things that have to be done to make forms, especially the validations, accessible.

#### Nr. 5 — Fix keyboard focus visibility and order
This is easy to test. Open your website or application and navigate through it without using the mouse (Tabulator key, Shift+Tabular and arrows are your friends, but there are more).
