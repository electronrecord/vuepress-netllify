#### What is a design system and how does it help?
A design system (or design library) is a collection of guidelines, style guides, and reusable components that enable rapid creation of mockups and support faster build-out of features. It can answer specific questions from what fonts and colours are used on websites, to how buttons and panels are displayed.

#### Step 1 — Audit your website or app and make a list
#### Step 2 — Organize using pages
#### Step 3 — Create layer styles and text styles (skip this step if you do not have Sketch)
#### Step 4 — Create symbols/components
#### Step 5 — Ongoing updates to the design system




## Lightning design system

The Salesforce Lightning Design System includes the resources to create user interfaces consistent with the Salesforce Lightning principles, design language, and best practices. Rather than focusing on pixels, developers can focus on application logic, while designers can focus on user experience, interactions, and flows.
