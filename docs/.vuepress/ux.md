So, you know that design defines the success of most software products. And software development discovers new ways to use the design for various products.

**1. Don’t use more than two typefaces**

Only amateurs call typefaces “fonts”, you know? “Proper” design professionals call them “typefaces” Fonts are the files on the device that the software uses to render the typeface. Fonts are the paint on the palette, while the typeface is the masterpiece on the canvas.

**2. Users Already Have Fonts on Their Computers, So Use Them**

Yes, your corporate brand font is lovely. It’s so playful and charming but it takes an extra three seconds to load the page, as the font needs to be downloaded from the server and rendered — and nothing appears until it loads — driving your users crazy.

**3. Use Type Size to Depict Information Hierarchy**

**4. Headline that tells you something**

**5. Use a Sensible Default Size for Body Copy**

Body copy in 16px, with a 1.5 line height and “auto” or “default” character spacing, is usually a safe bet and a good default for the vast majority of your users.

**6. Use an Ellipsis to Indicate that There’s a Further Step**


## Home Page UX

In general, home page can include the following data:
- the nature of the website: the page has to instantly inform users if it’s a company website, blog, e-commerce website, social network, educational platform or anything else;
- brand or company identity elements: home page requires a recognizable visual presentation distinguishing the website from its competitors. If there is a product, company or brand behind it, webpage design should consistently reflect its identity. In other cases, the website itself should be seen as a brand and apply strategies of identity design for better brand awareness.
- benefits of the website: it should quickly inform users why the website can be helpful or interesting for them.
- internal search: many users come to the websites with clear goals, so functionality to search right from the homepage will make interaction highly productive
- links to the core interaction zones
- contact data and links to social networks
- signs of trust: testimonials, reviews, big numbers of presence in social networks etc.
